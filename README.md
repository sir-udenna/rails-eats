Back-End for rails-eats written in Ruby on Rails

This application was created for my phase 5 project for Flatiron School in Houston, Texas. The purpose of this project is to solve the problem of finding food when you're hungry in a timely manner. I know when you're hungry you don't want to search for endless results on the web looking for the right place to eat. Wouldnt it be much easier if you can see the food first and find the location at the click of a button? With "EATS." that's exactly what you can do with this easy-to-read UI, created using Material UI, you can easily choose a place to eat without the hassle of searching through hundreds of results.
